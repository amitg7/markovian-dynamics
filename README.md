# Welcome to Markovian-dynamics

## Introduction

Markovian-dynamics is a python package built to simplify dynamics calculations in thermodynamic systems.

It's mainly intended for the scientific community in the fields of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics.

## Features

- Equilibrium probability distribution of discrete system
  - Symbolic representation
  - Vectorized creation of multiple equilibrium points
- Rate matrix
  - Symbolic representation in Arrhenius form
  - Creation of multiple rate matrices
  - Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
  - Eigenvectors coefficients of probability points
- Dynamics
  - Evolve probability distribution in time (trajectories)
- Plotting module
  - Visualization for three-state system
- Vectorization
  - Support for (almost) all functions
